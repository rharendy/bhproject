### **Centralized Network Equipment in the Garage**

1. **Location**: Place the **router**, **network switch**, and **PoE injectors** or a **PoE-enabled switch** in a secured, ventilated section of the garage near the NBN box. This minimizes cable runs from the incoming internet connection to the rest of the house.
   
2. **Power and Ventilation**: Ensure adequate power outlets are available in this area and consider proper ventilation or a small network cabinet to protect equipment from dust or temperature fluctuations.

3. **Structured Cabling**: Run Cat6 or higher cables from the garage to each room for Ethernet and CCTV PoE ports.

### **Revised Room-by-Room Ethernet and CCTV PoE Port Plan**

#### **1. Living Room**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - **TV Area**: Two Ethernet ports for streaming devices or consoles.
     - **Study Area**: Additional port for workstations.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - Position a ceiling-mounted camera port to monitor entryways or shared areas.

#### **2. Kitchen/Dining Area**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - One port near an accessible area for smart appliances or Wi-Fi extender.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - One camera port near the ceiling to monitor rear entries.

#### **3. Bedrooms (1, 2, and 3)**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - Place an Ethernet port near the main desk in each room.
     - If applicable, a second port can go near the TV or media space.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - No direct need inside bedrooms, but consider a hallway camera covering the entry to the rooms.

#### **4. Home Office/Studio**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - Place two Ethernet ports for desktop computers or VoIP setups.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - Optional, unless close to a main entry.

#### **5. Entryway/Garage**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - Garage: Add a port for any smart devices, including vehicle monitoring or automation controls.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - Place ports for exterior cameras in key locations:
       - **Front Entry**: Monitor the front door and yard.
       - **Back Entry**: Oversee the backyard or secondary entrances.
       - **Garage**: Keep an eye on vehicles and stored items.

### **Garage Network Setup**

With the NBN box, network switch, and PoE gear in the garage:
- Use a **patch panel** if you have multiple rooms connected, keeping cable management tidy.
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**: Optional but can keep your network and cameras running during power outages.

Based on the suggested design, here’s the breakdown of Ethernet ports per room:

1. **Living Room**: 3 ports (2 near the TV, 1 in the study area).
2. **Kitchen/Dining Area**: 1 port.
3. **Bedrooms (1, 2, and 3)**: 1 port each (total of 3 ports).
4. **Home Office**: 2 ports.
5. **Garage**: 1 port.

### Total Ethernet Ports:
- **3 (Living Room) + 1 (Kitchen/Dining) + 3 (Bedrooms) + 2 (Home Office) + 1 (Garage) = 10 Ethernet Ports**

### Summary
The total number of **Ethernet ports** in this setup is **10**.

# Redudancy

Using a network equipment enclosure with power outlets from two different panels is a good idea, especially for redundancy and reliability. Here’s why:

1. **Power Redundancy**: Connecting to separate panels provides backup power if one circuit or panel experiences an outage. This setup is useful for keeping critical equipment, like your network and CCTV, running.

2. **Load Balancing**: Network equipment can consume significant power, especially if you have a router, switch, PoE injectors, and possibly a UPS. Distributing the load across two circuits helps prevent overload on a single circuit.

3. **UPS Integration**: If you plan to include a UPS, connect it to one of the power outlets to keep key equipment operational during short power outages. The second panel can be connected directly to the main equipment, providing an alternative power path.

For the best results, work with an electrician to set up outlets on separate circuits, ideally labeled for easy identification in the enclosure.
