### **Centralized Network Equipment in the Garage**

1. **Location**: Place the **router**, **network switch**, and **PoE injectors** or a **PoE-enabled switch** in a secured, ventilated section of the garage near the NBN box. This minimizes cable runs from the incoming internet connection to the rest of the house.
   
2. **Power and Ventilation**: Ensure adequate power outlets are available in this area and consider proper ventilation or a small network cabinet to protect equipment from dust or temperature fluctuations.

3. **Structured Cabling**: Run Cat6 or higher cables from the garage to each room for Ethernet and CCTV PoE ports.

### **Revised Room-by-Room Ethernet and CCTV PoE Port Plan**

#### **1. Living Room**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - **TV Area**: Two Ethernet ports for streaming devices or consoles.
     - **Study Area**: Additional port for workstations.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - Position a ceiling-mounted camera port to monitor entryways or shared areas.

#### **2. Kitchen/Dining Area**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - One port near an accessible area for smart appliances or Wi-Fi extender.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - One camera port near the ceiling to monitor rear entries.

#### **3. Bedrooms (1, 2, and 3)**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - Place an Ethernet port near the main desk in each room.
     - If applicable, a second port can go near the TV or media space.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - No direct need inside bedrooms, but consider a hallway camera covering the entry to the rooms.

#### **4. Home Office**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - Place two Ethernet ports for desktop computers or VoIP setups.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - Optional, unless close to a main entry.

#### **5. Entryway/Garage**
   - **Ethernet Ports**:
     - Garage: Add a port for any smart devices, including vehicle monitoring or automation controls.
   - **CCTV PoE Ports**:
     - Place ports for exterior cameras in key locations:

### **Garage Network Setup**

With the NBN box, network switch, and PoE gear in the garage:
- Use a **patch panel** if you have multiple rooms connected, keeping cable management tidy.
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**: Optional but can keep your network and cameras running during power outages.

Based on the suggested design, here’s the breakdown of Ethernet ports per room:

1. **Living Room**: 3 ports (2 near the TV, 1 in the study area).
2. **Kitchen/Dining Area**: 1 port.
3. **Bedrooms (1, 2, and 3)**: 1 port each (total of 3 ports).
4. **Home Office**: 2 ports.
5. **Garage**: 1 port.

### Total Ethernet Ports:
- **3 (Living Room) + 1 (Kitchen/Dining) + 3 (Bedrooms) + 2 (Home Office) + 1 (Garage) = 10 Ethernet Ports**

### Summary
The total number of **Ethernet ports** in this setup is **10**.
